# Brainfuck Interpreter in C
- Does the error when backets no good ✔
- Does the brainfuck ✔
- Does be made by me ✔

## Usage
1. Compile: `gcc ./src/brainfuck.c`
2. Run with input: `./a ./examples/hello-world.b`
- Output: `Hello world!`

- You can ignore `config.bat` (that's used for my build system)
